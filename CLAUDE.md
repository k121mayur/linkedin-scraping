## Overview

A **prompt-driven LinkedIn job extraction engine**. A user types a plain-English request
("Extract NGO sector junior accountant roles in India, max 100 jobs"); the engine parses intent
into a structured search plan, drives LinkedIn via Playwright, scores each job for relevance with
an LLM, persists to SQLite, and exports to xlsx/csv/json. A Flask web UI streams live progress
over Server-Sent Events.

Key features:
- Natural-language prompt → structured `SearchPlan` (LLM, with heuristic fallback)
- Self-broadening search loop ("self-refinement") when results run dry
- Pluggable LLM layer (OpenAI / Ollama / Anthropic) over raw `urllib`, no SDK
- Graceful degradation: any LLM/Playwright/JSON failure falls back to heuristics — the run never hard-fails
- SQLite persistence with cross-run dedup; xlsx/csv/json export

## Build & Development Commands

```bash
# Setup (Python 3.10+)
python3 -m venv venv && source venv/bin/activate   # Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
playwright install chromium

# Run the web app (defaults to DRY_RUN=true — safe, no LinkedIn/LLM calls)
python app.py                       # serves http://localhost:5000
DRY_RUN=false python app.py         # real scrape — needs LinkedIn creds + LLM key in .env

# Production (Docker)
docker compose build && docker compose up

# Production (Raspberry Pi + Cloudflare Tunnel)
sudo ./run.sh                       # idempotent installer
```

**There is no test suite** — do not invent test commands. Verify changes by running the app in
`DRY_RUN=true` (the full pipeline runs against mock data) and exercising the HTTP API.

<!-- AUTO-MANAGED: architecture -->
## Architecture

The pipeline is a linear transform chain, each stage in its own `engine/` module:

```
prompt → prompt_parser.parse() → SearchPlan dict
       → search_strategy.build_queue() → ordered [SearchItem(query, location)]
       → self_refinement.run() drives the loop:
            linkedin_client.search()      → job cards
            job_extractor.detail_pass()   → cards enriched with full descriptions
            relevance.filter_relevant()   → jobs scored, kept if ≥ RELEVANCE_THRESHOLD
            database.upsert_job()          → SQLite persistence + dedup by linkedin_job_id
       → exporter.export_*()              → xlsx / csv / json
```

Directory layout:
```
app.py                  Flask routes + SSE; spawns each scrape in a daemon thread
config/__init__.py      ALL env vars read once here (single source of truth)
config/ai_config.py     LLM prompt templates + AI constants (AI_BATCH_SIZE=10)
engine/
  prompt_parser.py      prompt → SearchPlan (LLM, _heuristic_parse fallback)
  search_strategy.py    builds primary + relaxed (broadening) SearchItem queues
  self_refinement.py    ORCHESTRATOR — generator, yields Progress, loops to max_jobs/max_attempts(25)
  linkedin_client.py    Playwright driver (module-global _browser/_page singletons)
  job_extractor.py      detail_pass() enriches cards with full descriptions
  relevance.py          batched LLM 0.0–1.0 scoring, _keyword_score fallback
  database.py           SQLite: search_runs, jobs, search_attempts; auto-inits on import
  exporter.py           xlsx (pandas/openpyxl) / csv / json
  llm_client.py         pluggable LLM over urllib: openai / ollama / anthropic
templates/index.html    web UI (prompt form + live progress bar via EventSource)
data/                   auto-created; jobs.db + exports (git-ignored)
_archive/               superseded standalone scripts — reference only, NOT live code
```

Key files to read first: `app.py` → `engine/self_refinement.py` → `config/__init__.py`.

HTTP endpoints (in `app.py`): `GET /`, `POST /scrape` (→ run_id), `GET /stream/<run_id>` (SSE),
`GET /download/<run_id>/<fmt>`, `GET /runs/<run_id>`, `GET /health`.

<!-- AUTO-MANAGED: conventions -->
## Code Conventions

- **Python, snake_case** for functions/variables; `from __future__ import annotations` at the top of engine modules; type hints used throughout.
- **Pure-stdlib HTTP** (`urllib`) — deliberately no `requests`/`openai`/`anthropic` SDK. Keep new outbound calls consistent.
- **Centralized config**: add new env knobs in `config/__init__.py`, not via scattered `os.getenv` calls.
- **Defensive boundaries**: every external boundary (LLM, Playwright, JSON parse) is wrapped in try/except with a heuristic or empty fallback. Preserve this "never crash the run" posture.
- **Data shape**: stages pass plain `dict`s, except the `SearchItem` and `Progress` dataclasses. The canonical job-id key is `linkedin_job_id` once a card is enriched (`job_id` on raw cards).

<!-- AUTO-MANAGED: patterns -->
## Detected Patterns

- **Generator-based orchestration**: `self_refinement.run()` is a generator that `yield`s `Progress` dataclasses (consumed by the Flask SSE stream) and `return`s the final job list.
- **LLM + heuristic fallback pair**: `prompt_parser` and `relevance` each have an LLM path and a keyword/regex fallback (`_heuristic_parse`, `_keyword_score`) selected on `DRY_RUN` or LLM failure.
- **Provider dispatch map**: `llm_client` selects `_call_openai`/`_call_ollama`/`_call_anthropic` from a dict keyed on `LLM_PROVIDER`.
- **Background-thread + queue + SSE**: `POST /scrape` returns immediately; work runs in a daemon thread pushing `Progress` onto a per-run `queue.Queue` drained by `GET /stream/<run_id>`.
- **Thread-local SQLite** with WAL mode; dedup by unique `linkedin_job_id` via `seen_job_ids()`.

## Git Insights

- The project was rebuilt from standalone Selenium/Playwright scripts (now in `_archive/`) into the prompt-driven engine — see commit "Prompt based scrapping". Original design notes live in `PLAN.md`, `TASKS.md`, `AI_SCRAPER_PLAN.md`.
- Deployment evolved toward Raspberry Pi + Cloudflare Tunnel (`run.sh`, multiple "Updated run.sh" commits) after earlier Render deployment attempts.

## Custom Notes — Critical gotchas

These are hand-written and never auto-modified.

- **`DRY_RUN` defaults to `true`** (see `config/__init__.py`). In dry-run, `linkedin_client.search`
  returns mock cards, `get_job_detail` returns mock descriptions, and relevance uses keyword
  matching — *zero* network calls to LinkedIn or the LLM. Real extraction requires `DRY_RUN=false`
  AND valid `.env` credentials. Most "why is it returning fake jobs" confusion traces back to this.

- **The SQLite DB auto-initializes on import** of `engine/database.py` (the module ends with a bare
  `init_db()` call). Importing the module creates `data/jobs.db`.

- **Playwright state is module-global** (`_browser`, `_page` singletons in
  `engine/linkedin_client.py`) and **not thread-safe**. The Flask app runs each scrape in its own
  daemon thread, so concurrent runs would race on the shared browser. Treat single-run-at-a-time as
  the supported model.

- **Default LLM provider** is `ollama` against `https://ollama.siliconmango.in` (auth via
  `x-api-key` header), model `gemma4:31b`. Switch via `LLM_PROVIDER` / `LLM_MODEL` in `.env`.

- **Self-refinement broadening order** when the primary queue is exhausted before reaching the
  target (`search_strategy.build_relaxed_queue`): drop sector keywords → widen locations → drop
  location → single broad keyword.

- **Gmail IMAP verification** (`GMAIL_*` env vars) is configured but **not wired into the live
  code** — it was deferred (TASKS.md T14). Ignore those settings for now.
